# Drift Detectors Benchmark: detailed results

The following tables show the results of the drift detection experiments separated per dataset (one table = one dataset).
Each table show the p-values for the six shift detectors for the sizes [10, 100, 500, 1000, 2000] for 19 types of shifts listed in the first column, 
and for one scenario of absent shift (last row). 
The p-values are averaged across 5 runs.

Negative numbers mean that the drift scenario with a specific dataset size could not be built, thus there is no related drift detection experiment (i.e. for some datasets 
it is not possible to have 2000 samples, while removing 10% of a class in `ko_shift_0.1_0`). These cases are not accounted for, when computing the aggregated metrics of average 
accuracy and true positive rate.
